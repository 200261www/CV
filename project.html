<p><span>Project Name</span>: Create a personal website</p>

	<p><span>Hardware</span>: Server, Hard disk, Router, Database</p>
	<p><span>Software</span>: Dreamweaver, Notepad++, Canva</p>
</div>
	<h2p>Value</h2>

	<p> In the process of creating this website, I can learn more basic knowledge related to the website, and by creating the website, I can also have a platform to show myself on the Internet, so that the public can know me more intuitively.</p>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>I will use the Dreamweaver to design the website. Also, using Notepad and Canva to help me code better and make beautiful logo. And I will also use the server to connect the network and store information, use the database to store and share data, etc. Using hard disk to store data on electronic devices, use Router to provide wireless access to individual computers and other devices.</p>
